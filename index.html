        <h3> Breaking limits, rewriting the game.</h3>
        <p>
        Cristiano Ronaldo was born in 1985 on the island of Madeira, Portugal, into a very poor family. His father worked as a gardener and his mother as a cook, and life was extremely difficult. From an early age, he had a deep love for football, spending most of his time playing in the streets, sometimes even using a cloth ball or shoes as a substitute. Despite his father's illness and the family's poverty, Ronaldo never stopped dreaming. At the age of 12, he left his family and traveled to Lisbon to join Sporting CP's academy, where the real struggle began. He had no money and no family around, but he had determination and strong belief in himself. Thanks to that willpower, he later became one of the greatest football players in history.
